Problem Statement
    
Hero is learning a new algorithm to encode a string. You are given a String s that consists of lowercase letters only. Your task is to simulate the algorithm described below on this string, so that Hero can see how it works.  The algorithm starts with a given input string s and an empty output string t. The execution of the algorithm consists of multiple steps. In each step, s and t are modified as follows:
If the length of s is odd, the middle character of s is added to the end of t, and then deleted from s.
If the length of s is even, the two characters in the middle of s are compared. The smaller one of them (either one in case of a tie) is added to the end of t, and then deleted from s.
If after some step the string s is empty, the algorithm terminates. The output of the algorithm is the final string t.  Return the String t that will be produced by the above algorithm for the given String s.
Definition
    
Class:
MiddleCode
Method:
encode
Parameters:
String
Returns:
String
Method signature:
String encode(String s)
(be sure your method is public)
Limits
    
Time limit (s):
2.000
Memory limit (MB):
256
Notes
-
When comparing letters, the smaller one is the one earlier in the alphabet - i.e., the character with the smaller ASCII code.
Constraints
-
s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each character in s will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
Examples
0)

    
"word"
Returns: "ordw"
In the first step, 'o' is smaller than 'r', thus 'o' is selected.
After the first step: s="wrd", t="o".
After the second step: s="wd", t="or".
In the third step, 'w' is greater than 'd', thus 'd' is selected.
After the third step: s="w", t="ord".
After the fourth step: s="", t="ordw", and the algorithm terminates.
1)

    
"aaaaa"
Returns: "aaaaa"

2)

    
"abacaba"
Returns: "caabbaa"

3)

    
"shjegr"
Returns: "ejghrs"

4)

    
"adafaaaadafawafwfasdaa"
Returns: "afawadafawafaafsadadaa"
